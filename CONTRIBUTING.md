# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Proposing new features
- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix or feature
- Discussing the current state of the project

## Filing a bug or feature

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests.

Fill out the entire template. Put `N/A` if you are unable to fill out a section. Further discussion may happen on the issue if more information or clarification is required.

## Submitting changes

Before you request to submit a change, be sure an issue is created on the board with the appropriate category.

1. Fork the repository so that you can work on your changes locally
2. Create a working branch and start making your changes.
3. Make your changes
    1. If you've changed interfaces, note that you have made a breaking change.
    2. Update any examples in the repository to reflect your changes.
    3. Update any documentation.
    4. Make sure your code lints.
4. Once you have finished making your changes, create a pull request (PR) back to the original repository
5. Don't forget to link the PR to the original issue if you are solving one
6. Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits]([url](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)) so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a maintainer will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
7. Once all changes have been made and the PR has been approved, a 'maintainer' will merge the request into the repositoy
